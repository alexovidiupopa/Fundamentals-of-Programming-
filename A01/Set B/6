#Determine the age of a person, in number of days.
#We know that a normal year has 365 calendar days, and every 4 years, a year has 366 calendar days.
#Therefore, we can say that for n the age in years, the age in days would be equal to n*365 + [n/4], where 
#"[]" denotes the mathematical function floor.
